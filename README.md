#### Simon says game:
It’s a classic childhood game. The challenge is to repeat the ever-increasing sequence of signals. Do you have the memory and reflexes to beat Simon? The more you can remember, the higher score you have! Challenge your limit and go higher!

#### Text Translator: 
Translation is an act through which the content of a text is transferred from the source language into the target language. This feature is very useful to me since I am learning languages and it will help me translate words that I do not know.

I downloaded the google-translated package from this url: https://www.npmjs.com/package/translate-google

So far this package is working fine and I have tested a few which are either under maintenance and have few critical issues to be resolved.
